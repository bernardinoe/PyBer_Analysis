The purpose of the analysis was understand the ride sharing business in the different city types. We calculated average fare per ride and per driver and presented by city type. Additionally, we did an analysis of total fares in a week by city types.

The ride sharing has higher volume in urban areas than suburban and rural. At the same time the number of available drivers is greater in urban than suburban and rural. The average fair per ride is higher in the rural areas, follow by suburban and the cheapest is in the urban areas.

There is a no real trend on the data. Most of the weeks there is one week up and then one week down. The third week of February there is a peak in the fare in all 3 city areas.


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

In order to increase the use of ride sharing I would recommend the following:

- Increase the number of drivers in the rural and suburban areas
- As driver increase, the rate per drive can be reduced, in order to increase the use of ride sharing
- I would limit the number of drivers in the urban areas, as there are more drivers than rides.
